Installation:

    git clone git://github.com/??? ~/.dotfiles

Create symlinks:

    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

Switch to the `~/.vim` directory, and fetch submodules:
    For Pope's Plugin Manager: 

    cd ~/.dotfiles
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

    For Vundle Plugins:

    2. Setup Vundle:
    >
    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    <
    3. Configure bundles:

    Put this at the top of your `.vimrc` to use Vundle. Remove bundles you
    don't need, they are for illustration purposes.
    >
    set nocompatible              " be iMproved, required
    filetype off                  " required

    " set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
    set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    call vundle#begin()
    " alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
    "call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

    " let Vundle manage Vundle, required
    Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

    " The following are examples of different formats supported.
    " Keep Plugin commands between vundle#begin/end.
    " plugin on GitHub repo
    Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
    " plugin from http://vim-scripts.org/vim/scripts.html
    Plugin 'L9'
    " Git plugin not hosted on GitHub
    Plugin 'git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git'
    " git repos on your local machine (i.e. when working on your own plugin)
    Plugin 'file:///home/gmarik/path/to/plugin'
    " The sparkup vim script is in a subdirectory of this repo called vim.
    " Pass the path to set the runtimepath properly.
    Plugin 'rstacruz/sparkup', {'rtp': 'vim/'}
    " Avoid a name conflict with L9
    Plugin 'user/L9', {'name': 'newL9'}

    " All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
    call vundle#end()            " required
    filetype plugin indent on    " required
    " To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
    "filetype plugin on
    "
    " Brief help
    " :PluginList          - list configured plugins
    " :PluginInstall(!)    - install (update) plugins
    " :PluginSearch(!) foo - search (or refresh cache first) for foo
    " :PluginClean(!)      - confirm (or auto-approve) removal of unused plugins
    "
    " see :h vundle for more details or wiki for FAQ
    " Put your non-Plugin stuff after this line

    4. Install configured bundles:

    Launch vim and run
    >
    :PluginInstall
    <
    To install from command line:
    >
    vim +PluginInstall +qall
    "

  279  ln -s dotfiles/* .
  280  lall
  281  for file in !(addons|dotfiles) ; do mv "$file" ".$file" ; done

NOTE THAT mintty needs to be run as "mintty -" so that it sources the bash scripts that add cygwin's bin 
folder to its path
Else it will not find most binaries like ls and cd .
